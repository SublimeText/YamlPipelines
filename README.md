# Yaml Pipelines for Sublime Text

Syntax highlighting definitions for YAML pipeline files, like GitHub Actions and AzureDevops.
Includes a small plugin to automatically apply the GitHub Actions filetype when loading or saving a YAML file in a `.github/workflows` folder.

Why not just use the default YAML syntax definition? Because it doesn't highlight conditions, variables or embedded Bash or PowerShell scripts!
